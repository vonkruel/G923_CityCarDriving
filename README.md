# G923_CityCarDriving

This project is for supporting the Logitech G923 wheel, pedals and optional shifter in City Car Driving (PC).
Presently, only the XBOX variant of the G923 (which I own) has been tested.

## How to use this?

1. Unpack the `data` folder into the game's root folder (which has its own `data` folder).  
For example, on my PC the game's root is `F:\games\Steam\steamapps\common\City Car Driving`
2. In the game's Steam properties, make sure Steam Input is disabled.
3. Choose the G923 in the game and enjoy.
