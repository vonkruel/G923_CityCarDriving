# G923_CityCarDriving

This project is for supporting the Logitech G923 wheel, pedals (and optional shifter) in City Car Driving (PC).
Presently, only the XBOX variant of the G923 is supported because that's the version I have.

## How to use this?

1. Unpack the contents of this repository into game's root folder.  
-- for example, on my PC that folder is `F:\games\Steam\steamapps\common\City Car Driving`
2. In the game's Steam properties, make sure Steam input is disabled.
